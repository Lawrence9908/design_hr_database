# Desing and HR Database
## Project Overview
In this project, I have undertaken the task of designing, building, and populating a comprehensive database tailored to meet the specific needs of the Human Resources (HR) Department at Tech ABC Corp, an imaginative video game company. The project was initiated in response to a request from the HR Manager to address the challenges posed by the company's rapid growth. With Tech ABC Corp expanding from a small 10-person operation to 200 employees across 5 locations in less than a year, the HR team has outgrown its current system of maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. This project aims to create a robust database that can efficiently manage and organize all employee-related data.

The process began with a thorough analysis of the department's requirements and the foundational principles of data architecture. I proceeded with the creation of database proposals, entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and eventually built the actual database itself. This project holds significant importance as it emulates real-world assignments data architects encounter regularly.

## Business Requirments
Tech ABC Corp experienced a period of explosive growth with the launch of their AI-powered video game console. As a result, the company expanded rapidly, requiring HR to manage an increasing amount of employee data. The existing spreadsheet-based system that sufficed for ten employees became impractical and unwieldy. To streamline HR operations, the department sought a database solution capable of efficiently managing employee information.
